> Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites

**Jekyll** is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites. Written in Ruby by Tom Preston-Werner, GitHub's co-founder, it is distributed under the open source MIT license.

### Features
Instead of using databases, Jekyll takes the content, renders Markdown or Textile and Liquid templates, and produces a complete, static website ready to be served by Apache HTTP Server, Nginx or another web server. Jekyll is the engine behind GitHub Pages, a GitHub feature that allows users to host websites based on their GitHub repositories for no additional cost.

Jekyll is flexible and can be used in combination with front-end frameworks such as Bootstrap, Semantic UI and many others.

Jekyll sites can be connected to cloud-based CMS software such as CloudCannon, Forestry, Netlify or Siteleaf, enabling content editors to modify site content without having to know how to code.
